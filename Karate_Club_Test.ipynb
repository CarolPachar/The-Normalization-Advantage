    "(i) What the Code Does: \n",
    "The `spectral_cluster_and_evaluate` function performs Spectral Clustering on a given graph and evaluates the performance of the clustering result. It takes the Laplacian matrix of a graph (`L_matrix`), the true group labels (`true_labels`), and the number of clusters (`num_clusters`) as input. It then executes the Spectral Clustering algorithm, measures the execution runtime, and calculates the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to compare the resulting clusters against the true labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) In short, this function serves as a way to apply the spectral clustering algorithm, record the time it takes to perform the clustering \n",
    "process (runtime), and to quantify the quality of the clustering result using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). \n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) How it works:\n",
    "1) Timing Start: It records the start_time before the computation begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Eigen-decomposition: It computes the $(k+1)$ smallest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix (where $k$ is the `num_clusters`). It uses `np.linalg.eigh` for symmetric matrices, with a fallback try/except block to ensure robust execution. The eigenvectors are then sorted by the magnitude of their eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Embedding Creation (Dimensionality Reduction): It discards the first eigenvector (which is trivial and associated with the eigenvalue of $0$) and takes the next $k$ eigenvectors. These $k$ eigenvectors form the new feature space, or embedding, for the graph nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) K-Means Clustering: It applies the standard K-Means algorithm to the $k$-dimensional embedding. The results of the K-Means clustering are the final `predicted_labels` for the graph nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Timing End & Runtime Calculation: It calculates the runtime by subtracting the `start_time` from the current time (`time.time()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Performance Evaluation: It calculates the `ari_score` by comparing the `predicted_labels` with the `true_labels` using `adjusted_rand_score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Return: Finally, it returns the calculated `runtime`, `ari_score`, and the `predicted_labels`."
